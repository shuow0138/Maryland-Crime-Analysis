An analysis by Shuo Wang and Chenhongshu Yu

We attempt to find the number of crimes and potential trends between crimes and counties in Maryland from 1990 to 2017.

Conclusion: 
The crime ratio(total crime number over population) of Maryland is decreasing as time goes. Though, there are county like Baltimore and Prince George's that the crime number is large, the crime ration is decreasing.

We are happy to see this result based on our analysis. It means that, even if there are ups and downs in the past 30 years, the society of Maryland State is going towards a more safe and stable environment. For further research, we can also conduct the relationship between violent crime and property crime in the past 30 years.
